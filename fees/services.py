"""Business-logic layer for the fees app.

Services extend :class:`core.services.BaseService` so every write auto-stamps
``created_by``/``updated_by``, emits an :class:`~core.models.AuditLog` row and
invalidates the cached fee views. All fee business rules live here — never in
views: recomputing invoice status, and the ``pay`` flow that records a
:class:`~fees.models.Payment` and marks the invoice paid.
