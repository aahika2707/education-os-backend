"""RBAC matrix for the materials viewset.

Contract (assignments/materials/quizzes row): student **R**, parent
**R(child)**, faculty **RW(own)**, hod **R(dept)**, principal **R**, admin
**RW**. Concretely:

- Everyone authenticated may read the material list/detail (the student
  ``?subjectId=`` view). Deeper scoping (child/dept) is refined in the view.
- Creating materials (``create`` / ``POST /materials`` upload) + the faculty
  ``faculty_materials`` list are faculty + admins.
- Update/delete are faculty (own) + admins.
