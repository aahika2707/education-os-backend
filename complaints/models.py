"""Complaints domain model.

A :class:`Complaint` is a grievance a campus member (typically a student or a
parent-on-behalf-of-child) raises against the institution: a category, a subject
line, a free-text description, and a status that moves through a small workflow
(``open`` -> ``in_progress`` -> ``resolved``).

It backs the mobile ``complaintService`` (``types.ts`` ``Complaint`` shape:
``category``/``subject``/``description``/``status``/``createdOn``) plus the
Principal/Admin ``complaintMonitoring`` surface (all complaints + status counts).

Every complaint is owned by the ``user`` who filed it (drives the "own"
scoping of ``GET /complaints``). Every model extends
:class:`core.models.BaseModel` (UUID PK, audit, soft-delete).
