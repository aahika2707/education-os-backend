"""RBAC matrix for the complaints viewset.

Contract (complaints row): student **RW(self)**, parent **RW(child)**, faculty
**R**, hod **R**, principal **R(monitor)**, admin **RW**. Concretely:

- ``list`` / ``retrieve`` — any authenticated role. Students/parents are scoped
  to their own complaints in the view; staff see the wider scope.
- ``create`` (``POST /complaints``) — the members who raise complaints
  (students + parents) plus admins.
- ``partial_update`` (``PATCH /complaints/{id}`` status transition) — staff only
  (they run the workflow); admins included.
- ``monitor`` (``GET /complaints/monitor``) — principal + admins only.
