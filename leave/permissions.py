"""RBAC matrix for the leave viewset.

Contract (leave row): student **RW(self)**, parent **approve(child)**, faculty
**RW(self) + approve(students)**, hod **approve**, principal **R**, admin
**RW**. Concretely:

- ``list``/``retrieve`` (own requests) — any authenticated role; the view scopes
  the queryset to the requester (staff/parent see the requests they can act on).
- ``create`` (apply) — anyone who can file leave: student/parent/faculty/hod +
  admins. (Principal is read-only per the matrix.)
- ``approve``/``reject`` — parent/faculty/hod + admins; object-level scoping in
  the service enforces *whose* leave each approver may decide (parent→child,
  faculty/hod→students in their department, admin→all).
- ``update``/``destroy`` — the owner refines their own pending request; admins
  may manage any.
