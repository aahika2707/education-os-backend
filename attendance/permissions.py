"""RBAC matrices for the attendance viewsets.

Contract (BUILD_CONTRACT attendance row):
``student R(self) · parent R(child) · faculty RW(own classes) · hod R(dept) ·
principal R · admin RW``.

Concretely, self-scoped student reads (``/attendance/summary``, ``/overall``,
``/records``) are open to any authenticated user; the view scopes the data to the
requesting user's own :class:`students.Student` record. The faculty session
endpoints (``POST /attendance``, ``GET /faculty/attendance``) admit faculty +
admins; object-level owner-scoping to a faculty's own classes is enforced in the
view/service.
