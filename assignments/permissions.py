"""RBAC matrices for the assignments viewsets.

Contract (assignments/materials/quizzes row): student **R + submit**, parent
**R(child)**, faculty **RW(own)**, hod **R(dept)**, principal **R**, admin
**RW**. Concretely:

- Everyone authenticated may read the assignment list/detail (students see their
  own per-student status; scoping to child/dept/self is refined in views).
- ``submit`` is student-only.
- Creating assignments (``create`` / ``POST /assignments``) and the faculty
  ``faculty_assignments`` list are faculty + admins.
- Update/delete are faculty (own) + admins.
