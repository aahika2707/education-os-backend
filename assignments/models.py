"""Assignment domain models.

An :class:`Assignment` is created by a faculty member for a subject (and,
optionally, a specific :class:`faculty.FacultyClass`). It carries the shared
metadata every student sees — ``title``/``description``/``due_date``/
``max_marks`` — plus a ``status`` that mirrors the app's faculty view of an
assignment's lifecycle (``pending``/``submitted``/``graded``/``late``).

A :class:`Submission` is one student's turn-in for an assignment: the uploaded
``file_name``, ``submitted_at`` timestamp, and an optional ``grade`` once the
faculty marks it. The mobile student-facing ``Assignment`` shape (``types.ts``)
carries a *per-student* ``status``/``submittedAt``/``grade``/``attachmentName``;
those are derived at read time from the current student's submission (see
``serializers.StudentAssignmentSerializer``).

Every model extends :class:`core.models.BaseModel` (UUID PK, audit fields,
soft-delete).
