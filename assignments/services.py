"""Business-logic layer for the assignments app.

Each service extends :class:`core.services.BaseService` so writes auto-stamp
``created_by``/``updated_by``, emit an :class:`~core.models.AuditLog` row, and
invalidate cached assignment views. Assignment reads are cached under the
``assignments`` prefix; any write busts that prefix.
