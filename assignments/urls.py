"""Assignments URLs. ``config/urls.py`` mounts this under ``/api/v1/`` so paths
resolve to:

- ``/api/v1/assignments/`` (list, ``?status=``) + ``POST`` create,
- ``/api/v1/assignments/{id}/`` (retrieve),
- ``/api/v1/assignments/{id}/submit/`` (student turn-in),
- ``/api/v1/faculty/assignments/`` (faculty-created list).

The faculty list is a ``detail=False`` action on the same viewset; it is routed
at the top-level ``faculty/assignments/`` path (rather than nested under the
``assignments/`` prefix) to match the mobile contract exactly.
