"""Background jobs for the ai app.

:func:`generate_ai_response` is the Celery task that produces an assistant reply
through the **pluggable LLM interface** (:mod:`ai.llm`). It works with no LLM
key configured because :func:`ai.llm.generate` degrades to a canned,
feature-specific fallback that mirrors the app's ``aiService`` responses.

The task supports two modes:

- *stateless* (``thread_id`` omitted): just compute and return the reply text.
  Used by ``POST /ai/:feature/respond`` when it wants the work off the request
  thread. The synchronous endpoint calls :func:`ai.llm.generate` directly for a
  fast round-trip; the task exists so heavier real-LLM calls can be enqueued.
- *persisting* (``thread_id`` given): compute the reply, append an assistant
  :class:`~ai.models.AIMessage` to the thread, touch the thread, and bust the
  cached thread views. Used to finish an async ``send`` when a real (slow) LLM
  is wired in.
