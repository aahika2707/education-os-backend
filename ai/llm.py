"""Pluggable LLM interface + canned, feature-specific fallback.

This module is the single seam where a real LLM can be wired in later. Today it
ships a deterministic, feature-specific *canned* generator that mirrors the
mobile app's ``aiService.buildResponse`` output, so the AI endpoints work with
**no LLM API key** configured.

Design:

- :data:`LLM_PROVIDER` is a module-level callable
  ``(feature: str, prompt: str, *, history=None) -> str``. It defaults to the
  canned fallback :func:`canned_response`.
- To plug a real model, call :func:`set_llm_provider` (e.g. from an app-ready
  hook or settings) with a function that calls your provider of choice; if it
  raises, :func:`generate` falls back to the canned response so requests never
  hard-fail on provider errors.
- :func:`generate` is what the service/Celery task call. It never raises on
  provider failure — it degrades to canned text.

Keeping the provider abstract (a plain callable) means the ``ai`` app has **no
hard dependency** on any particular SDK; the concrete integration lives wherever
:func:`set_llm_provider` is invoked.
