"""AI assistant domain models.

Mirrors the mobile app's ``types.ts`` shapes:

    AIFeatureKey = 'mentor' | 'doubt' | 'notes' | 'assignment'
                 | 'resume' | 'career' | 'chat'
    AIMessage    = { id, role: 'user' | 'assistant', text, at }
    AIThread     = { id, feature, title, messages: AIMessage[] }

An :class:`AIThread` is one per-feature conversation owned by a single
``user`` (the app keeps a single thread per feature — see
``aiService.getThread`` which finds/creates by feature). An :class:`AIMessage`
is one turn in that thread, either the ``user`` prompt or the ``assistant``
reply, timestamped by ``at``.

Every model extends :class:`core.models.BaseModel` (UUID PK, audit fields,
soft-delete). Ownership is enforced in the view/service layer (own threads
only).
