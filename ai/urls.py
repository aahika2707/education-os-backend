"""AI URLs. ``config/urls.py`` mounts this under ``/api/v1/`` so the paths
resolve to ``/api/v1/ai/...``.

The endpoints are feature-keyed and non-CRUD, so instead of a router we bind the
:class:`ai.views.AIViewSet` actions explicitly. Ordering matters: the more
specific ``threads/<feature>/messages`` route is declared before the shorter
``threads/<feature>`` so it wins the match.
