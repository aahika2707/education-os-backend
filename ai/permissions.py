"""RBAC for the ai app.

The AI assistant is a personal surface: **every authenticated role** may use it,
but only against **their own** threads. There is no cross-user access and no
admin-broadcast surface here, so the matrix simply admits all roles for the
custom actions; ownership is enforced object-level in the view (threads are
always filtered/created for ``request.user``).
