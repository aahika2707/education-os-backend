"""RBAC matrices for the hostel viewsets.

Per the BUILD_CONTRACT matrix (library/hostel/transport row): every role may
read hostel data; only admins may create/update/delete blocks, rooms and
allocations.

The ``info`` action (``GET /hostel``) returns the *requesting* student's own
allocation, so any authenticated role reaches it — the queryset scopes it to the
caller's linked Student record.

ADMINS = list(Role.ADMINS)        # super_admin, admin

# Block/room/allocation management: everyone reads; only admins mutate.
