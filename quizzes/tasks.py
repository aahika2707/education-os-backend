"""Background jobs for the quizzes app.

Currently a placeholder: quiz creation is synchronous and cheap. AI-assisted
quiz generation (the ``ai`` module's ``quiz-gen`` feature) enqueues its work
there; if we later add heavy post-create work (e.g. notifying enrolled students
that a new quiz is live), it belongs here as a Celery task.
