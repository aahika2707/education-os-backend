"""RBAC matrix for the quizzes viewset.

Contract (assignments/materials/quizzes row): student **R**, parent **R**,
faculty **RW (own)**, hod **R**, principal **R**, admin **RW**. Concretely:

- ``list``/``retrieve`` are readable by every authenticated role.
- ``create`` (faculty POST /quizzes with nested questions) is allowed for
  faculty and admins.
- ``update``/``partial_update``/``destroy`` are restricted to faculty + admins
  (owner-scoping for faculty is enforced object-level in the view). The mobile
  contract only exercises list/retrieve/create, but the mutating actions are
  matrixed for completeness.
