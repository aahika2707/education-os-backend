"""RBAC matrices for the students viewsets.

Roster CRUD (list/retrieve/create/update/destroy) is staff/admin only — students
and parents do not browse the institutional roster. Each student reads/edits
their own profile via the ``me`` action; parents (and staff) may read a child's
profile, allowed for now via a staff-or-self object check.
