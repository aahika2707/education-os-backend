"""Celery tasks for the academics app.

Timetable and subject reads are cached (TTL 3600s). This task lets an operator
proactively rebuild/warm those caches (e.g. after a bulk import) instead of
paying the first-request cost. It is intentionally light — the source of truth is
always the DB and the service layer already invalidates on writes.
