"""Celery tasks for the notifications app.

``send_push_notification`` is the async push-delivery fan-out (stub). A real
implementation would look up device tokens and hand the payload to FCM/APNs; for
now it resolves the notification, computes the audience, and also pushes the new
item to any connected WebSocket clients via the Channels group layer so the
mobile app updates in realtime. It is enqueued by
:meth:`NotificationService.broadcast` (and can be called for per-user rows too).
