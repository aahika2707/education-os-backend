"""RBAC matrix for the notifications viewset.

Per the BUILD_CONTRACT matrix (notifications row): every authenticated role
reads their own notifications; only admins broadcast. The read/write actions
here operate on the requesting user's own data (enforced in the viewset by
scoping the queryset to the user), so all roles may call them; the ``broadcast``
action is admin-only.
