"""Faculty domain models.

A :class:`FacultyProfile` is the teaching identity of an ``accounts.User`` with
role ``faculty`` (its department + designation + the subject codes they teach).
A :class:`FacultyClass` is a concrete teaching assignment: a subject taught to a
particular semester/section by a faculty member, with the weekly ``slots`` grid
and a cached ``student_count``. :class:`RosterEntry` lists the students enrolled
in a class.

The mobile ``students`` app is not yet built, so the roster stores the
``RosterStudent`` shape (``name``/``rollNo``/``avatarColor``) denormalized, with
an optional ``student_ref`` UUID so entries can be linked to
``students.Student`` rows once that module lands. Every model extends
:class:`core.models.BaseModel` (UUID PK, audit fields, soft-delete).
