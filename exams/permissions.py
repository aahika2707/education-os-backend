"""RBAC matrices for the exams viewsets.

Contract (marks/results row): student **R(self)**, parent **R(child)**, faculty
**RW(own classes)**, hod **R(dept)**, principal **R**, admin **RW**. Concretely:

- Exams and results are readable by everyone (self-scoping applied in the views:
  a student only ever sees their own results/exams).
- Result CRUD and exam CRUD are restricted to staff who own the marks
  (faculty/hod/principal read; admins + faculty write).
- The faculty marks-entry endpoints (``POST /marks``, ``GET /faculty/marks``) are
  faculty + admins; object-level scoping to "own classes" is enforced in the
  view/service.
