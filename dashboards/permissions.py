"""RBAC for the dashboards app.

Each dashboard endpoint is a self-scoped read for the owning role, with staff /
admin allowed to read (for support/monitoring). The matrices drive
:class:`core.permissions.RoleModelPermission`; the views additionally enforce
object-level self-scoping (a student only ever sees their own dashboard, a parent
only their child's, a faculty only their own) by resolving the current user's
linked record — the role check here is the coarse gate.

Per the BUILD_CONTRACT RBAC matrix ("own profile/dashboard"):
    student RW(self) · parent R(child) · faculty RW(self) · hod RW(self) ·
    principal R · admin R
