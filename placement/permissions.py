"""RBAC matrices for the placement viewsets.

Per the BUILD_CONTRACT matrix, placement postings are in the
"library/hostel/transport/events/certificates" family — **read for everyone,
read-write for admins**. Students additionally apply to openings and read their
own applications; principals may monitor stats (institution read).

from core.permissions import Role

ADMINS = list(Role.ADMINS)          # super_admin, admin
ALL_ROLES = list(Role.ALL)
# Roles allowed to see aggregate placement stats: admins + principal (monitor).
STATS_ROLES = list(Role.ADMINS) + [Role.PRINCIPAL]

# Openings: every authenticated role browses; admins manage.
# ``apply`` (student turn-in) and ``applications`` (own list) are open to any
# authenticated role — object scoping in the action limits them to the caller's
# own student profile. ``stats`` is admin + principal.
