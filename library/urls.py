"""Library URLs. ``config/urls.py`` mounts this under ``/api/v1/`` so the paths
resolve to:

* ``GET  /api/v1/library/books``        — app-shaped catalogue search (``?q=``)
* ``GET  /api/v1/library/loans``        — requesting student's own loans
* ``GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/library/books-admin/…`` — admin book CRUD
* ``…/library/loans-admin/…``           — admin loan management

The app-facing ``books``/``loans`` reads are bound as explicit collection routes
so their paths match the mobile contract exactly; the admin CRUD resources live
under distinct basenames to avoid colliding with those fixed paths.
