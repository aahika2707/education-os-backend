"""RBAC matrices for the events viewsets.

Per the BUILD_CONTRACT matrix, ``events`` is **read for everyone** and
**read-write for admins**: every authenticated role may browse events and toggle
their own registration; only super_admin/admin may create/update/delete events.

# ``list``/``retrieve`` are the router-backed admin reads.
