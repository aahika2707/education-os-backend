"""RBAC for the chat viewset.

Chat is parent ↔ teacher messaging. Per the contract only the two thread
participants may see or act on a thread — enforced *object-level* by
:class:`IsThreadParticipant`. The role matrix additionally gates which roles may
touch the chat endpoints at all: parents and faculty (the two participant roles)
plus admins (support/oversight). Students/HOD/principal have no chat surface in
the app, so they are excluded.
