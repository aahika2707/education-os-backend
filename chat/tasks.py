"""Background jobs for the chat app.

Chat's realtime path is synchronous (the service broadcasts to the Channels group
inline). This Celery task exists for the *out-of-band* side channels — e.g.
push/email notifying an offline recipient of a new message — so the request never
blocks on external delivery. The view/service can enqueue it after persisting a
message; delivery integrations are pluggable.
