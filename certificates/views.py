"""HTTP layer for the certificates app.

``CertificateViewSet`` serves two audiences:

* the mobile app's ``GET /certificates`` (the requesting student's own
  certificates) via the ``mine`` custom action, and
* admins' full issue/CRUD over the certificate table via the standard
  ModelViewSet actions.

All writes flow through :class:`CertificateService` (audit + cache-invalidate).
