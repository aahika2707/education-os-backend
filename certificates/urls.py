"""Certificate URLs. ``config/urls.py`` mounts this under ``/api/v1/`` so the
paths resolve to:

* ``GET  /api/v1/certificates``                      — requesting student's own
  certificates (mobile contract, app-shaped)
* ``GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/certificates-admin/…`` — admin issue/CRUD

The app-facing read is bound as an explicit collection route so its path matches
the mobile contract exactly; the admin CRUD resource lives under a distinct
basename to avoid colliding with that fixed path.
