"""RBAC matrix for the certificates viewset.

Per the BUILD_CONTRACT matrix, ``certificates`` is **read for everyone** and
**read-write for admins**: every authenticated role may read certificates (the
``mine`` custom action scopes non-staff to their own records), while only
super_admin/admin may issue/update/delete them.
