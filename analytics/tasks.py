"""Celery tasks for the analytics app.

Analytics is read-through-cached on demand (TTL 300s), so no background work is
required for correctness. This optional task pre-warms the institution-wide
Principal caches (e.g. from a nightly ``django-celery-beat`` schedule) so the
first dashboard hit after cache expiry is instant. HOD caches are per-user/dept
and warmed lazily on access.
